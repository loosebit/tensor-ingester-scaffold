  NOTES

  To keep track of progress I chose to read most recent state written to a file.
  It is done only once when the program starts (and if an exception is thrown).
  As file grows it will become less efficient, however there are ways to optimized this.
  For example, the file can be read from the bottom or a separate state can be maintianed.
  I would also expect that in a real-life implmentation a database would be used, and
  finding the most recent signature would take little time.

  In recards to part C, I am leaning:
  1. Towards saving a signature even if it is returned by only one provider, but I may be missing
    something here.
  2. To make sure we don't miss any signatures I chose to only save signatures that are returned
    by no fewer than 2/3 of the providers and next time fetching from the last signature saved.
    There's a possible infinite loop there if we continue to get that same signature from one
    provider and not the others. This can be handled by counting number of times we saw this
    case and moving on after enough attempts have been made (I did not implement this approach
    here). However, this case would be indicative of a problem elsewhere, likely with providers.
    In reality I would expect such signature either to eventually be returned by other providers
    or disappear altogether. Although, this could thake time, so in production I'd add a safe
    guard as mentioned above.
